OpenArchive routes, preserves, and amplifies mobile media in user-created collections in an <a href="https://archive.org/">accessible public trust</a>, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. 
<br>
<br>

Citizens armed with mobile devices are becoming history’s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today's breaking news. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to government censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media.
<br>
<br>

<p>We are doing better.
</p>
<br>
OpenArchive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, in the process creating a world where the people’s history is a primary history.
